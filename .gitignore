# Future Enhancements
# Here are several ways you can expand the functionality and sophistication of your Stock Market Data Analyser:

# 1. Advanced Historical Data Analysis & Visualization
# Data Storage: Instead of just displaying, store this historical data. Consider:

# CSV files: Simple for quick storage.

# SQLite database: A lightweight, serverless database (sqlite3 is built into Python) for more structured data storage and querying. This would allow you to avoid refetching data constantly.

# More Chart Types: Explore candlestick charts, volume bars, or other financial visualizations using Matplotlib or mplfinance (a library built on Matplotlib specifically for financial plotting).

# Comparison Charts: Allow users to plot historical prices of multiple stocks on the same chart for comparison.

# 2. Portfolio Management
# Create a Portfolio: Allow users to add multiple stocks to a "portfolio" along with the number of shares they own and their purchase price.

# Calculate Portfolio Value: Sum up the current value of all stocks in the portfolio.

# Track Profit/Loss: Calculate the overall profit or loss for the portfolio based on current market prices versus purchase prices.

# Persistence: Save the portfolio data (e.g., to a JSON file or a SQLite database) so it persists between sessions.

# 3. More Technical Indicators
# Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): A trend-following momentum indicator.

# Bollinger Bands: Volatility bands plotted above and below a simple moving average.

# Fibonacci Retracements: Tools used to identify potential reversal levels.

# Libraries: Libraries like ta-lib (Technical Analysis Library) or pandas_ta can simplify these calculations.

# 4. Improve User Experience
# Graphical User Interface (GUI): This is a significant step up but makes the application much more user-friendly.

# Tkinter (Built-in): Good for simple desktop applications.

# PyQt/PySide (More Advanced): For more professional-looking and feature-rich desktop applications.

# Streamlit (Web App - Highly Recommended for Data Apps): Extremely easy to turn your Python scripts into interactive web applications with minimal code. You could have input fields for symbols, display data in tables, and show interactive charts.

# pip install streamlit

# (To run a Streamlit app, you would execute streamlit run your_app_script.py instead of python your_app_script.py)

# Flask (Web App - More Control): If you want a more traditional web development experience, Flask is a good choice.

# Interactive Command-Line Interface:

# Use libraries like Typer or Click for more robust command-line argument parsing and subcommands (e.g., analyser --symbol AAPL --history).

# Add colorized output using colorama or rich for better readability.

# 5. Robustness and Deployment
# Advanced Error Handling: Implement more specific error messages for different API responses.

# Rate Limiting: Alpha Vantage has API call limits. Implement a delay mechanism in your code to avoid hitting these limits (e.g., time.sleep() between calls).

# Testing: Write unit tests for your functions using unittest or pytest to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
